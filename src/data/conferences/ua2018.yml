    title: Speed up application testing with Azure Container Instances.
    description: "There is no chance how we can surprise anyone right now with usage of Docker containers. We use them in every project for everything from dev to prod environment. But recently we faced quite an issue with our tests automation. We have one enormous solution that consists of huge amount of independent modules (microservices). Our single build agent has 8 cores and 32 gigs of RAM under the bonnet, but it’s not enough anymore. Currently we can wait for more than an hour for all tests to pass. We started thinking about how to improve those numbers. During my session I will share our concept of running multiple environments simultaneously in a cloud and executing all the tests in parallel. The key differentiator here is that not only application itself runs inside Docker containers, but test assemblies do that too. Another interesting challenge we faced (and overcame) was about combining all the tests results in one single report. As a result we were able to maintain more or less the same infrastructure cost, but reduce dev team idle time from 60 minutes to 10 minutes per pull request."

    title: "Azure Container Service - from zero to hero."
    description: "В течении лабораторной работы мы будем разбираться что такое Docker и \"с чем его едят\". Мы создадим базовый контейнер и научимся его публиковать в публичный/приватный репозиторий. Разберемся с построением собственных образов и каким образом компоновать несколько контейнеров и как правильно настраивать \"общение\" между ними. К концу дня вы: поймете что такое Docker и насколько это удобный инструмент; сможете сами создавать свои контейнеры; научитесь работать с публичными/приватными репозиториями; сможете создать свою собственную aka \"production\" архитектуру для запуска контейнеров в Azure. По завершению воркшопа у вас будет собственный контейнер который будет запущен как локально, так и в облаке управляемый оркестратором."

    title: "Build, deploy and manage your releases like a boss"
    description: "Unfortunately, there are still a lot of projects where engineers deploy their apps using \"Right click -> Deploy -> Productio\" approach. This is sad, but true. At some point we can face this just because no one knows how to configure a build server, how to automate deployment process. And, for some reason, a lot of engineers believe that it is some super complicated stuff. During my speech I will talk about general approaches for automating build, deployments and managing releases. After short talk we will go straight to the demos. In no more than 15 minutes I will configure automated build process for my app and automated deploy to several different environments. I will wrap all of this in release management pipeline and show how to make the entire release process transparent for all team members."
