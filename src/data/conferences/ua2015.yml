    title: Publish web applications to Azure Web Sites using built-in Kudu server.
    description: "We all know that you can easily configure publication of our application on Azure Web Sites from Git repository located, for example, on GitHub. The process of setting up this publication looks quite simple and at first glance it looks like a simple copying of files, although in reality this is far from that. While running the publication of the application, we can pre-run all automatic tests and not publish anything if there were failed tests. We can choose, for example, what kind of project we want to publish if we have several in the same repository. We can also change many other settings and during my session I will show how this incredible magic works."

    title: Mobile criminology. Analysis of Windows Phone backup copies.
    description: "Today, the criminalist's job of recovering evidence from various gadgets becomes more and more important. Practice reveals that recovering information from a smartphone running Windows Phone 8 isn't easy at all.

    title: Scaling the relational database in Azure. Myth or reality?
    description: "Scalability of the application has become a critical design element after the transition from a model of individual programs to a server-based application model. Scalable applications can cope with more active use and increased data volume. Scalable applications have high availability and fault tolerance. Scalable applications are manageable and maintainable. All of this is true with respect to all layers of the application, including the database. Scaling the database is a complicated process. Azure had already an attempt to scale the database, and for sure many people remember SQL Azure Federations and why the good idea turned out to be not so good. At present, Federations are a deprecated functionality and Microsoft presents a new model of database scaling in the cloud: Elastic Scale. In this presentation we will look at why the Federations failed, how developers took into account old mistakes during creation of a new product, and whether Elastic Scale is so good to use in a serious project."
