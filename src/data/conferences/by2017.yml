    title: SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE – A NEW BUZZWORD OR SOMETHING USEFUL?
    description: "At first it sounds crazy: how can it be that my server code can run without a server? Then – ok, we are not paying for dedicated resources, we are paying for on-demand resources based on exact load. Seems really cool, isn’t it? But hey, if I will pay for on-demand resources, then I should make all my cloud code serverless tomorrow morning, so I can reduce TCO for my project. Yeah, but no.  As usual there is no silver bullet and you will always have pros and cons of any approach. During my speech, I will talk about one of my community educational projects that I made based on serverless architecture approach.
