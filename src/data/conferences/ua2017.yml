    title: Abusing Azure Functions.
    description: Many of us had at least heard, someone maybe even tried to work with Azure Functions - a serverless platform in Microsoft Azure cloud. From the first glimpse it looks great and even I started to feel a strong desire to rewrite all my Web API`s using my new "favorite framework of the day". At some point it may seem like a lot of benefits, but Azure Functions is just a tool. As any other tool it has usage scenario for which it was designed. And, to benefit from it, you need to know what those scenarios are and to use the tool properly. During this talk I will go through common mistakes of misusing Azure Functions, misunderstanding serverless architecture and suffering from continuous pain till the end of times.
