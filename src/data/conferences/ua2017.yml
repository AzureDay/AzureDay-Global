    title: Abusing Azure Functions.
    description: "Many of us had at least heard, someone maybe even tried to work with Azure Functions - a serverless platform in Microsoft Azure cloud. From the first glimpse it looks great and even I started to feel a strong desire to rewrite all my Web APIs using my new \"favorite framework of the day\". At some point it may seem like a lot of benefits, but Azure Functions is just a tool. As any other tool it has usage scenario for which it was designed. And, to benefit from it, you need to know what those scenarios are and to be able to use the tool properly. During this talk I will go through common mistakes of misusing Azure Functions, misunderstanding serverless architecture and suffering from continuous pain till the end of times."

    title: How Far Can ‘Serverless’ Actually Go?
    description: "Azure Functions are getting a lot of traction, which is completely understandable in the fast-paced world of applications developed using Agile methodologies. Comparing the world of IT and software development today with the one 10 years ago, when we knew not only what operating system our application was going to run on but also the exact part number of the server that was running the workload, we can only conclude that PaaS infrastructures have made great progress and moved far ahead! But how far? How far can you go and how far is actually advisable to go when it comes to externalizing your infrastructure, anyway? Throughout this fast-paced advanced talk we will take the real microservices approach and develop a full application, top-to-bottom using Azure Functions. Seatbelt buckled yet?"
