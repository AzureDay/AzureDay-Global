    title: Complex Event Processing with Azure Stream Analytics.
    description: "Azure Stream Analytics targets complex event streams to deduce meaningful patterns. Most of the typical use cases for this product is when various devices and sensors are sending data for further processing. This technology uses a T-SQL like syntax to express its intents, a language that most data powerusers will be familiar with. The biggest advantage of Stream Analytics is that when events are being published to the Stream Analytics, the only thing that event publishers need to know is in which Event Bus or Blob storage to place the data. Stream Analytics will then fetch the data. This talk is about the main concepts and solution architecture when using Azure Stream Analytics, and also usage scenarios of this technology with MS SQL Server, DocumentDB, Azure SQL Database and Power BI."
