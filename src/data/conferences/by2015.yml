    title: Getting familiar with Azure Application Insights.
    description: "Various Azure services have built-in capabilities for collecting diagnostic information and monitoring. We are faced with the task of extracting data from raw information of metrics and knowledge about how effectively these or other components and subsystems work. The main goal of the speech is to give an overview of Azure Application Insights and how they can help in solving the abovementioned problem."
    speaker:
      name: Andrei Dzimchuk
      bio: "Software Architect in ScienceSoft. He started programming on Sinclair in the early 1990s. Then he came down to writing the disk shell bypassing the operation system. After a short break, in the beginning of 2002, he got carried away by C++ and Windows programming. He was interested in: multithreading, thick clients, COM, network, databases, DirectShow. He started writing the first version of Power Video Player, which was soon ported to Windows Forms, and later to WPF. In 2004, Microsoft abolished C++ and MFC certification. After a bit of a grief, he read the Proses's Programming .NET Framework and since then has not looked back. A fairly tight review of ASP.NET in that book caused Andrei's interest in the web development. In the same year he joined ScienceSoft, where he developed a multi-platform system for diagnostics and monitoring the security of information systems. In 2007, after this product moved to IBM, he ported the product to WebSphere, DB2, Linux, and AIX. In recent years he worked closely with Microsoft Azure. Now he creates a system that allows you to \"connect\" cars to the cloud and in some way to control them using mobile and web applications"

    title: Azure Storage - how to maximize speed and performance.
    description: "The speech will contain two parts. In the first part, we'll talk about Azure Storage generally, consider what services it consists of (Blobs, Disks, Files, Tables, Queues) and talk about which tasks we can use each service for. We'll learn the best practices and recommendations for using each service for maximum performance. This part of the speech will be aimed at listeners who are just beginning their acquaintance with cloud technologies. In the second part of the speech, we will discuss Azure Table Storage in more detail - a service for storing structured data in the cloud. There are many myths about different aspects of this service, during the speech we will dispel some of them. Also, with years of experience, developers may have some prejudices about storage systems. Many people upon hearing the wording \"data storage\" immediately begin to think about MS SQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc. But do we really need this in the project? Imagine that we are developing a highload messaging system - do we need a relational database in this project? This part of the speech will be of interest to those who want to immerse themselves into Azure Table Storage as deep as possible, to find out where the rake is buried and how to properly \"cook\" this service. Also, during this speech, we will try to emphasize that you do not need to choose technology depending on your tasks, the right way is when you get the tasks, then choose the right technology to solve them."

    title: Visual Studio 2015 for the web, cloud, containers and any of you
    description: "With the release of .NET 2015 and Visual Studio 2015, as well as the development of ASP.NET 5, developers start to use increasingly more effective tools for creating cross-platform web applications that can run on Windows, as well as Linux and OSX. New tools in Visual Studio 2015 allow you to build web applications faster, publish them to the cloud and Docker containers, manage the increasing number of cloud-based environment functions directly from the development environment. As part of the speech, we'll look at the many new features that Visual Studio 2015 brought us: from Entity Framework 7 to ASP.NET 5, from new Azure capabilities to Docker containers, from new testing tools to security mechanisms and security in general."

    title: High availability in a hybrid cloud based on the Azure Traffic Manager
    description: "During the speech, we will talk about the testing of various high availability and fault-tolerant architectural patterns in a multi-chord configuration, as well as the implementation of the final solution based on Azure Traffic Manager. We tried to find the solution for organization of maximum availability and fault tolerance of applications in a hybrid cloud, as well as the migration of complex applications without downtime from one data center to another. By solving it we have tried several architectural options: Anycast IP, Global IP, Anycast DNS based on Nginx and bind, as well as Azure Traffic Manager. Jelastic is a container platform that can be installed in a private data center as well as in the global cloud, such as Microsoft Azure. A hybrid scenario is also possible, when part of the application is located in a private data center, and the other part is located in one or several Azure regions."
